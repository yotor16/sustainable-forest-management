Ideas on How Technology Can Aid Forest Management

1. Satellite Monitoring
   - Use satellite imagery to track deforestation, forest growth, and illegal logging activities in real-time.

2. Drones
   - Deploy drones to monitor remote forest areas, collect aerial images, and detect early signs of wildfires.

3. GIS Mapping
   - Apply Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map forest cover, biodiversity, and land use changes.

4. IoT Sensors
   - Install sensors to monitor soil moisture, tree health, and weather conditions to support sustainable forestry.

5. Blockchain
   - Use blockchain for transparent timber supply chain tracking, ensuring accountability and reducing illegal trade.

6. AI & Machine Learning
   - Analyze large datasets to predict forest fire risks, pest outbreaks, and optimize reforestation planning.

7. Mobile Apps
   - Develop apps to allow communities and rangers to report deforestation or forest fires quickly.

8. Cloud Platforms
   - Store and share forest data on cloud platforms for researchers, policymakers, and environmental organizations.
